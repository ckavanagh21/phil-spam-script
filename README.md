(The tutorial is slightly outdated. Ignore the part where I tell you to edit the file and instead just run it.)

Text instructions:
1. Download Python on your computer from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Python. Make sure that on the first screen when you see the checkbox "add Python 3.x to PATH", you check the box. This program won't work if you don't check it.
3. Once you have Python installed, access your computer's "terminal". There are instructions here: https://www.ionos.com/help/email/troubleshooting-mail-basicmail-business/access-the-command-prompt-or-terminal/
4. When you are in the terminal, type in (without qoutes) "pip install keyboard" and hit enter. 
5. Wait for everything to finish installing, and then exit out of the terminal.
6. Download and run the "spam-script.py" file from this repo.
